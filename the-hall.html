        <div class="split-bio">
  <p>Bristol Village was long a destination for summer tourists from Montreal and further afield. They would arrive on the CN train, to holiday on Bristol Beach and stay at the Pine Lodge Hotel.<br><br> The MacDougall Family, who owned the Lodge, built a dance hall between the Village and the Golf Course. To celebrate the coronation of George VI in 1937, the Hall was renamed. Over the years, touring orchestras, dances, and parties were held at Coronation Hall, making it the vibrant centre of the village. By the late 1960s, changing patterns in tourism led to the decline of the railway villages, and the Hall was closed.<br><br>Over the next 40 years, the Hall was largely forgotten. In 2003 we purchased it and began to restore it. In 2008 we opened to the public, and now the Hall is the summer home of the Pontiac Community Players, the site of weddings, parties, and other events. We like to think that it has reclaimed its role in the centre of the village again!</p>
